# My First Drupal Website

This project represents my work on a **Drupal website** that I built during and after my training with **Northern Commerce**. It includes a variety of features and customizations that I worked on, such as:

## Key Features:
- **Content Management:**
  - Created custom content types and structured content for the website.
  - Developed and styled custom **view modes** to display content in a variety of ways.
  - Configured **taxonomies** to help categorize and tag content effectively.

- **Customization:**
  - Stylized **view modes** using SCSS to ensure responsive and visually appealing layouts.
  - Installed and configured several essential **modules** to extend functionality.

- **Custom Development:**
  - Created custom **modules** for specific functionality required by the site.
  - Integrated custom modules as fields within the content types to enhance user experience.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Added a **webform** to allow users to submit requests, improving interactivity.
